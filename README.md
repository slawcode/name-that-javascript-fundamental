# name-that-javascript-fundamental
A timed coding quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript.

## Description
- The motivation for this project was Javascript and Web API's to create a timed quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript. Implementating and practicing JavaScript and Web API's is subsequently motivation for this project. 
- This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web API's. HTML and CSS provide the structure and styling of the page and JavaScript and Web API's in order to go through the carousel of questions and provide the interavtivity of the webpage. 
- Many challenges arose while making this project, time being the biggest challenge. A lack of time to work on the project and the code being time consuming to write. I underestimated the amount of time needed to work on all the features of this project and to get them functioning properly.   
- During the building of this project I learned a lot about JavaScript functions and utilizing a timer during the process.

## Usage
- To take this quiz, the user can access the webpage by placing the URL in a browser. The webpage does not require any authentications, like a password.
- The quiz starts once the 'Start Quiz' button is clicked and the user then has one minute, or 60 seconds, to select the answer from the multiple choice options provided. 
- After all the questions have been answered, the user can enter their initials and submit those initials.
- After submitting their initials, the user can view the high scores and/or go back to the initial page of the quiz, where the 'Start' button is accessible again.
