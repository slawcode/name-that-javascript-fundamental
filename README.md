A timed coding quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript.

## Description
- The motivation for this project was Javascript and Web API's to create a timed quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript. Implementating and practicing JavaScript and Web API's is subsequently motivation for this project. 
- This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web API's. HTML and CSS provide the structure and styling of the page and JavaScript and Web API's in order to go through the carousel of questions and provide the interavtivity of the webpage. 
- During the building of this project I learned JavaScript functions...and web API...how to circle through steps, and essentially questions and utilizing a timer during the process.

## Usage
- To take this quiz, the user can access the webpage by placing the URL in a browser. The webpage does not require any authentications, like a password.
- The quiz starts once the 'Start' button is clicked and the user then has one minute or 60 seconds, per question, to select what they think is the answer from the multiple choice options provided. 
- After all the questions have been answered, the user can enter their initials and submit those initials.
- After submitting their initials, the user can view the high scores and/or go back to the initial page of the quiz, where the 'Start' button is accessible again.
